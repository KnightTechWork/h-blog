## Have you heard of Polywork?

I recently joined Polywork, a professional networking site that is in beta. It features more ways to discover and connect with others for collaboration, or any other purpose. It has been a good experience so far. I am an early adopter of this, and I wanted to extend an open invitation to you. You may join by using this link:

If you do use it, please let me know what your initial impressions of Polywork are. Thanks ðŸ˜Ž
